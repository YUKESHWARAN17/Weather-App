🌦️ Weather Report App
I built a responsive weather application using React.js and TailwindCSS, powered by an external Weather API. This app allows users to:

🔍 Search for any city worldwide.

🌡️ View real-time temperature updates.

☁️ Get the current weather condition & description.

📱 Experience a clean, responsive, and modern UI with TailwindCSS styling.

This project highlights my skills in API integration, React state management, and responsive UI design.
